Project 2 - Openclassroom

The project was part of my Openclassrooms Full-stack developer path : https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/104-full-stack-developer

The skills acquired are :
- write documentation destined for non-technical users,
- select a WordPress theme based on client needs,
- adapt a WordPress theme to client needs

My first web project was to integrate a WordPress theme for an imaginary client which is a luxury real estate agency in Aspen, Colorado. 
I had some requirements to follow : choose the right theme for the project, separate the chalets for sale and the chalets for rent, and a 
contact page with a functionnal form. 

I already have two WordPress blogs, this project wasn't something unknown for me.
